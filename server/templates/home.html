      <p>Hi, my name is Gabriel Gamboa Vargas, I'm a senior studying Electrical Engineer at <a class = "text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-800" href="https://www.ucr.ac.cr" target="_blank">University of Costa Rica</a>, I'm not tired of studying though. Next year I will study Computer Science at <a class = "text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-800" href="https://www.tec.ac.cr" target="_blank">Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica</a> and Psicology at
      <a class = "text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-800" href="https://www.una.ac.cr" target="_blank">Universidad Nacional.</a></p>

      <p class="text-xs my-5">Check my <a class = "text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-800" href="/projects">projects</a> to see what I can do :)</p>

      <p><b>Why not just work and forget about college?</b> Most of my classmates and people that I know think that I'm crazy because I want to start two careers right when I'm at the finished line of Electrical Engineering. To understand why I want to do this you should know that <b>my dream is to become a leader</b> because it seems that the most significant and meaningful jobs require leadership. In order to achieve this one of the first things that I need is to be able to speak in a way that inspires other people to do their best, I believe that studying psicology is the best way that I have in hand to learn this. I also need a career that has more speaking and presentations because being articulate is absolutely necessary for a leader and to be honest for everyone else.</p>

      <p>Every single CEO a</p>
